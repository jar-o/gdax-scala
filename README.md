# gdax-scala

An unofficial Scala client for the Coinbase GDAX API.

(This is a work-in-progress, and I will add docs soon. In the meantime, I
suggest reading through `Sample.scala` for a demo on how to use it.)

## Getting started

You will need **Scala** (naturally) and [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
installed. This has a single dependency,
[scalaj-http](https://github.com/scalaj/scalaj-http), which should be fetched
by **sbt**. To run do

```
sbt run
```
